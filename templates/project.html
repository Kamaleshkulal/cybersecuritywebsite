           The global cybersecurity market is expected to record a compound annual growth rate of 13.4% by 2029. The increasing need to report security threats and government investments for protecting sensitive information can be considered the driving force of the global cybersecurity market. Businesses globally are investing their earnings in advanced cybersecurity professionals and solutions for safeguarding their sensitive data and assets as a result of the growing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks.
            </p>
            <p> <h3>
                Why Is Cybersecurity a Good Career Choice?</h3>
<p>
While the zero percent unemployment rate is definitely a compelling reason, it is imperative to consider other reasons before starting a career in cybersecurity. Following are some of the reasons why cybersecurity is a good career choice:
<p><h4>Limitless Career Advancement Opportunities</h4></p>
<p>
The increasing intensity and prevalence of security breaches in an ever-evolving digital landscape clearly indicate the escalating demand and growth potential of the cybersecurity industry. Abundant opportunities are available for individuals willing to advance their careers in cybersecurity.
</p><p><h4>High Paying Job Roles</h4></p>
<p>
Cybersecurity is a good career choice not only because it offers ample career growth opportunities but also because it is one of the highest paying industries. According to Diceâ€™s salary report, Cybersecurity Analysts saw a 16.3% average growth in salary between 2019 -2020, with the average annual salary being $103,106.
</p><p><h4>No Scope For Boredom In The Workplace</h4>
</p><p>
Cybersecurity solutions keep changing with evolving technologies and security threats. New skills and roles develop to match updated threats and technologies. There is absolutely no scope for monotony in this career.
</p><p><h4>Job Satisfaction</h4>
</p><p>
The ever-expanding industry of cybersecurity offers its employees enormous challenges. This enables security professionals to constantly learn and develop themselves to achieve a sense of job satisfaction.
</p><p><h3>Top Cybersecurity Projects</h3>
</p>
Independent cybersecurity projects allow individuals to assess and validate their technical skills, along with providing them with an opportunity to make their resumes compelling. Following are the top 6 cybersecurity projects that can aid in professional development and skill enhancement:
</p><p><h4>
Packet Sniffing</h4>
<p>
Packet Sniffing or Network Traffic Analysis is the process of tracking all incoming and outcoming traffic, network traffic, and availability using packet sniffers. Packet sniffers are used for comparing real-time networks and past data for detecting anomalies and potential vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p>
For this cybersecurity project you may do the following:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Monitor the information contained in the packets or the intended source and destination of the packets using Python.
    </li><li>
    Analyze the data packets transferred over the network
    </li><li>
    Generate a report after analyzing the packets
    </li><li>
    Develop software for detecting any data breach or ensuring the safety of the packet transfer process.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h4>
Keylogging</h4></p>
<p>
A keylogger is software used for tracking every keystroke made on a specific system using a keyboard device. It records user activity by monitoring the keys that were previously pushed and/or the ones that are currently in use. 
</p>
You may consider doing the following for this project:
</p>
<ul><li>
    Develop a keylogger software for detecting keyboard strokes.
</li><li>
    Develop a keylogger software for virtual keyboards. This is intended for advanced-level individuals as it can be difficult to pursue. 
</li><li>
    Develop software for detecting any keylogger in a system.
</li></ul>
<p>
This project is especially suitable for individuals interested in Machine Learning Cyber Security projects. 
</p>
<p><h4>
Decrypting Caesar Cipher
</h4></p><p>
Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest encryption algorithms that was used by Julius Caesar for communicating secretly with his trusted associates. 
</p><p>
Example
</p><p>
Text - ABCDE
</p><p>
Shift - 4
</p><p>
Cipher - EFGHI
</p><p>
In this example, every letter is replaced with an alphabet that comes four places after the original one.
</p><p>
For this project, you may develop software for decrypting the Caesar Cipher. This is a beginner-friendly project. However, if you want to do something more advanced, opt for encryption methods like RSA and DHK.
</p><p><h4>
Bug Bounties</h4>
</p><p>
A bug bounty or debugger is software that facilitates the detection of flaws in code. There are numerous bug bounty programs available online, so consider the one that reduces time and space complications. Although this might seem like a challenging project, you will get the opportunity of patenting and selling it to interested businesses upon completion.
</p><p><h4>
RFID Blocking </h4> </p><p>

The radiofrequency identifying tags present in credit and debit cards can be used by card scanners for stealing sensitive data in the name of quick contactless payments. RFID blocking refers to the process of identifying and restricting unauthorized scanning of cards, passports, and other sensitive documents. 
</p><p>
Following are some of the ideas that can be executed for this project :
</p>
<ul>
<p>
    <li>
    Create software for blocking RFID scanners from reading your cards. This can be done by masking the tags
    </li>
</p><p>
    <li>
    Develop an app for identifying readers accessing your cards.
    </li></p>
</ul>
<p><h4>
Encrypting Images
</h4></p><p>
Like words, images can also be encrypted. You may consider developing a program for remotely connecting users with security aspects like a login option. A transfer system can also be created and secured with powerful algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA, upon registration. You can also select a desirable method for connecting multiple sources of data transmission, like transferring data using remote networks and servers and encrypting it with keys. This will prevent any users from accessing the data without having the necessary keys for decryption. This project will reflect and validate your understanding of cryptography.
</p><p><h4>
Advance Your Career In Cybersecurity With Simplilearn
</p></h4><p>
Cybersecurity professionals must constantly develop new skills to handle emerging challenges and stay relevant in the ever-evolving cybersecurity industry. The best way of learning and strengthening relevant skills is by working on independent cybersecurity projects. The UCI Cybersecurity Bootcamp offered by Simplilearn is a great option for individuals who wish to start or advance their career in cybersecurity. The Bootcamp focuses more on real-world applications to make individuals industry-ready in just six months.
